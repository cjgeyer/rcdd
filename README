This is the source tree for the R contributed package rcdd.
The version for users is at CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org/package=rcdd)

The rcdd source tree is the subdirectory package/rcdd of this repo

This package uses autoconf.
To run R CMD check, first have to do

    cd package/rcdd
    autoconf

Then to run R CMD check

    cd package
    \rm -f rcdd/src/*.{o,so} rcdd/src/Makevars rcdd/config.status
    R CMD check rcdd

(the latter two commands are in the notes file in the package subdirectory
so they don't have to be remembered)

Also the vignette pdf isn't in the repo.  So to get it to R CMD check
without a warning have to do

    cd rcdd.Rcheck/rcdd/doc/
    R --vanilla
    library(rcdd, lib.loc = "../..")
    Sweave("vinny.Rnw")
    q()
    pdflatex vinny
    pdflatex vinny
    cp vinny.pdf ../../../rcdd/inst/doc
