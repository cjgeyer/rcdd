When all of the examples are run together in one R process, which is
what R CMD check does, there are more complaints than when they
are run in separate R processes, which is what ../examples/foom does.

Specifically valgrind complains about

 dd_FindDualFeasibleBasis (cddlp.c:1234)
     this is initiation of GMP rationals in vector rcost
 dd_SelectDualSimplexPivot (cddlp.c:575)
     this is initiation of GMP rationals in vector rcost
 dd_TableauEntry (cddlp.c:703)
     this is addition of GMP rationals in scalar temp
 dd_TableauEntry (cddlp.c:703)
     this is same line as previous
 ddf_ConditionalAddEdge (cddcore_f.c:428)
     this is malloc of object of typedef ddf_AdjacencyType in pointer NewEdge
