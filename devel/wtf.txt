exported R functions that call C functions to do computational geometry
    (as opposed to functions that just do rational arithmetic or conversion
    or fuss with H- and V-representations for convex polyhedra)

    allfaces
    linearity
    lpcdd
    redundant
    scdd

C functions that these call

    dd_ExistsRestrictedFace
    dd_FindRelativeInterior
    dd_ImplicitLinearityRows
    dd_LPSolve
    dd_MatrixCanonicalize
    dd_DDMatrix2Poly2

or the same with dd_ replaced by ddf_ if rational arithmetic is not being
used (only ordinary computer arithmetic) -- at least these are the
time-consuming functions that do the real work (I think).
