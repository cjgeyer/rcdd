This version adds to the vignette.

Reverse dependencies have been checked.  Some have notes in R CMD check,
but none seem to be my fault.  Some are about package size.  Some are
about Imports.  Some were about LazyData.

There were complaints from the python script checkbashisms done by
R CMD check --as-cran, but they were about the configure script produced
by autoconf version 2.69 which is fairly recent, so I guess it is OK.
Anyway I do not want to mess with its output.
