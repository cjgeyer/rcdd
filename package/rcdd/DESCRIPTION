Description: R interface to (some of) cddlib
    (<https://github.com/cddlib/cddlib>).
    Converts back and forth between two representations of a convex polytope:
    as solution of a set of linear equalities and inequalities and as
    convex hull of set of points and rays.
    Also does linear programming and redundant generator elimination
    (for example, convex hull in n dimensions).  All functions can use exact
    infinite-precision rational arithmetic.
