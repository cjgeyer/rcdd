Title: Computational Geometry
Author: Charles J. Geyer <geyer@umn.edu> and
    Glen D. Meeden <gmeeden@umn.edu>, incorporates code from
    cddlib (ver 0.94f) written by Komei Fukuda <fukuda@ifor.math.ethz.ch>
Maintainer: Charles J. Geyer <geyer@umn.edu>
Depends: R (>= 3.0.2)
Imports: methods
SystemRequirements: GMP (GNU MP bignum library from <https://gmplib.org/>)
Description: R interface to (some of) cddlib
    (<https://github.com/cddlib/cddlib>).
    Converts back and forth between two representations of a convex polytope:
    as solution of a set of linear equalities and inequalities and as
    convex hull of set of points and rays.
    Also does linear programming and redundant generator elimination
    (for example, convex hull in n dimensions).  All functions can use exact
    infinite-precision rational arithmetic.
