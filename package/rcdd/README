This package requires two libraries

    the GNU Multiple Precision arithmetic library (libgmp)

Obtain from http://swox.com/gmp/ or from your operating system vendor.
This is a standard GNU package and comes with many Linux distributions
and may be found at the web sites of other vendors that distribute free
software.

    the cddlib library

Obtain from http://www.ifor.math.ethz.ch/~fukuda/cdd_home/. You want
version cddlib-093d.tar.gz or later, because earlier versions had print
statements that make interactive use annoying.

Then compile as per the instructions in

    cddlib-093d/INSTALL
    cddlib-093d/README 

making sure to compile using the C compiler rather than the C++ compiler
(which is the default). If the GMP library is in a standard place, and
you want cddlib to go to a standard place (/usr/local), then something like

    CXX=gcc ./configure
    make install 

should work, otherwise something like

    CXX=gcc ./configure --prefix=/APPS 

may be necessary (installs in /APPS/lib, /APPS/include and so forth).

When both of the above libraries are installed, then

    export CPPFLAGS="-I/APPS/include"
    export LIBS="-L/APPS/lib"
    R CMD INSTALL rcdd_0.6-2.tar.gz

should install rcdd.  (If both libraries were installed in /usr/lib
and /usr/include) then neither of the "export ..." statements is necessary.
If they were installed in some other place, modify accordingly.
If you are using csh for you shell you need to know how to set an environment
variable in it.
